
This is the TODO file for cv2pdb, a 
converter of DMD CodeView debug information to PDB files

There are some quirks that you might run into when using 
Visual Studio to debug D programs. These will hopefully be removed 
in the future, but not all have a known solution.

* has to use '@' instead of '.' in class names to avoid confusing debugger, 
  but it looks ugly
* "this.var" is not a valid debugger expression, you have to use 
  "var" or "this->var"
* global/static vars have to be watched with full module and class name 
  specified (e.g. module@globvar)
* type of associative arrays is displayed as aa<*> to allow overload 
  in autoexp.dat
* DMD does not emit different debug information for const and invariant, 
  type info is the same
* type display of delegate does not have arguments 
* assoc_array.length cannot be displayed (it is assoc_array.a->nodes)
* enum values not displayed
* map dchar to something displayable
* workaround for ulong (written by DMD as int[])
