Prerequisites
-------------

For this program to be useful, you should have you should have the 
Digital Mars D Compiler (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/dmd-windows.html)
and either Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 2008 or one of the Express 
versions installed. cv2pdb uses one of the Microsoft DLLs to actually
write the PDB file.

Installation
------------
Sorry, there is no full featured installer available yet, you'll have
to do some simple manual steps to use cv2pdb.

1. The binary package of cv2pdb contains an executable cv2pdb.exe, which
should be copied somewhere accessible through your PATH environment
variable.

2. cv2pdb.exe must be able to locate the DLL mspdb80.dll from the Visual
Studio installation. It reads out the installation path of the latter, but
if this fails, mspdb80.dll should also be accessible through your PATH 
environment variable.

3. For best debugging experience, you should configure Visual Studio 
to use C/C++ syntax highlighting for D files. This is done by
navigating to the file extensions option page (found in Tools -> Options
-> Text editor -> File Extensions) and adding extensions "d" and "di"
with editor "Microsoft Visual C++". This will also enable display of
variables in the "Auto" watch window.

4. You should also add the contents of the file autoexp.snippet to the 
[AutoExpand] section of the file autoexp.dat found in 
<Visual Studio Installation Path>\Common7\Packages\Debugger.
Please note that in a standard installation of Visual Studio, the
section [AutoExpand] extends to the bottom of the file but a few lines
for the section [hresult].
These lines will enable a convenient display of strings, dynamic arrays, 
associative arrays and null references.

Building from source
--------------------
The source package comes with a Visual Studio 2008 project and solution
that work with both the Standard and the Express version. These won't
work in VS2005, but creating a VS2005 project should be easy.
