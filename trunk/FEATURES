Main Features

* conversion of DMD/DMC CodeView information to PDB file
* converted line number info allows setting breakpoints
* display of variables, fields and objects in watch, local and auto
  window and in data tooltips
* convenient display of dynamic and associative arrays in watch windows
* demangled function names for convenient display of callstack 

More features

This list is a bit more technical and shows what is actually done to
achieve the desired functionality:

* replaces '.' in class names with '@' to avoid confusing debugger
* converts class pointers to reference for "clss.field" syntax
* converts the type of member function, so that "this" is an object 
  pointer, allowing the debugger to display fields without "this."
* generates generic debug info for dynamic arrays, associative arrays
  and delegates
* creates readable type names for display of D specific types
* autoexp.dat formats output for dynamic and associative arrays in
  watch windows
* autoexp.dat filters display of null references
* adds object class debug info
* "char[]", "wchar[]" and "dchar[]" (D1) or "const char[]", 
  "const wchar[]" and "const dchar[]" (D2) translated to "string", 
  "wstring" and "dstring", respectively
* converts type delegate<void*,int> to __int64
* addin dviewhelper.dll allows correct display of D style strings 
  and derived object type 
* maps D basic types to enumerators to overload C style names
* add struct definitions for complex data types
